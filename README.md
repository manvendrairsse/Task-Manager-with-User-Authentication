# Task-Manager-with-User-Authentication
The Task Manager with User Authentication is a Python app that allows users to securely manage tasks. Users must log in with a unique username and password. Once logged in, they can add, view, complete, and delete tasks. File handling ensures data persistence, with tasks stored securely for each user.
